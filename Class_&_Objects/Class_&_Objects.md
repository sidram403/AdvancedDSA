# Class And Objects
## Basic concepts about Class and Objects in Advanced DSA ([Examples](Class&Objects.cpp))
## 1. Class
- In advanced data structures and algorithms (DSA), a class is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that represents a blueprint or template for creating objects that have specific properties and behaviors.
- A class defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.
-  classes are a powerful tool in advanced DSA because they allow you to organize complex data structures and algorithms in a modular and reusable way, and provide a high degree of abstraction that makes it easier to reason about your code. 
 

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Class Representation 
Class Student{
    ....... // Member Of Class
    .......
    .......    
};
```
